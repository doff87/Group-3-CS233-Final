# How the project worked:
Amandaleeanne Took meeting notes, arranged meetings and took lead as PM for smooth transition. Not much can be shown for this other than the Meeting notes submitted in the Meeting notes folder. However, within the first meeting notes you can see the genreal timeline and what everyone should have been doing and contributing to the project.

In general:
Dannika and Amandaleeanne worked in Figma for planning out the Presentation of the application.

Dannika worked on implementing the client side looks of the application (Client side and folder)

Joel and David worked on the Application layer and implementation of API's and the business logic controlling what happens when something in the client is interacted with.

Amandaleeanne worked on the Database layer by setting up AWS, and linking the database together and making sure the models were in-line with what was expected to happen with data as well as security.
