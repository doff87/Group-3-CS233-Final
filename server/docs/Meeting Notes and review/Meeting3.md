# Meeting topic: Implementation week and review of things done

David was absent from this meeting.
Dannika finished the presentation layer planning, and all is a go.
Joel worked on becoming familiar with the API implementation and produced some demo code, giving the team a rundown of how it would work.
Using this demo, it showed that the FDA API is a good thing to use, so we will be continuing and moving forward with this API.
Additionally, the demo code can be found in the demo branch.
Amandaleeanne has set up the AWS Database/VM for this project.

The new plan is a cascading effect for implementation:
First, it will be Dannika's job to complete the Client folder by EOD December 1rst, 
so that Joel and David can then create and work on the same Application layer branch from that by EOD December 3rd.
After the Application layer and the Presentation layer are complete, Amandaleeanne will hop in and create the models, 
allow for permanent data, and upload everything to AWS for testing by EOD December 5th.

Testing and changes will happen during the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th.
