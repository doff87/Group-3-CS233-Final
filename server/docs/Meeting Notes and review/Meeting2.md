# SCRUM Meeting 1

Discussion of which API to use was passed on to David and Joel, as multiple APIs have been discovered. Depending on which API the team decides on, Dannika and 
Amandaleanne (The Presentation layer team) will re-update the front-facing to reflect those changes.
As for the presentation layer, Amandaleeanne found out that Figma has a Design AI tool that helped her better visualize what the product would look like.
Dannika will review and finalize the app's look in the official Figma file, based on the concept generated by the AI tool.

The project currently looks set to start its next phase by Thursday, the 20th, with the application layer design complete and the API settled. Though the 
the true deadline is next Tuesday, the 25th.


# Extended:
Joel and David stuck around to discuss more details and get a clearer picture of which API to use. After some debate, the team decided to use the USDA API, meaning that
limitations on caloric intake would not be an issue. The team also discussed that the fields of Serving Size/Calories/Proteins/Carbs/Fats and then letting the user specify # of servings
for a meal would be good. 

Next meeting should bear more fruit in getting the application implemented and running once the Application layer team is familiar with the API.
