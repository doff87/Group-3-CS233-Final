This meeting was pretty short, as most people were clear on what was happening. Submission of the client-side branch has been completed, and polishing
for that is in the works this week. The implementation of the application layer will also be happening this week with Joel and David. Amandaleeanne will take over the project on Thursday in order to
finish up the implementation of the Database layer and security, as well as publishing it to AWS.
It seems like we are on track to do debugging and full polish for next week. Hopefully, everything can be submitted early!
