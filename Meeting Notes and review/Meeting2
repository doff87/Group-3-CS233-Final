# SCRUM Meeting 1

Discussion of which API to use was passed on to David and Joel, as multiple APIs have been discovered. Depending on which API the team decides on, Dannika and 
Amandaleanne (The Application layer team) will re-update the front-facing to reflect those changes.
As for the application layer, Amandaleeanne found out that Figma has a Design AI tool that helped her better visualize what the product would look like.
Dannika will be reviewing and finalizing the look of the app in the official Figma file using the concept done by the AI tool.

The project is currently looking like it will start its next phase by Thursday the 20th, with the application layer design complete and the API settled on.
